    "\n",
    "### Factors Making the 5-Flowers Dataset Suboptimal\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quantity\n",
    "\n",
    "- ML models typically require millions of images for training from scratch.\n",
    "- While there are alternative approaches that can work with fewer images, it's recommended to collect the largest dataset that's practically and ethically possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Format\n",
    "\n",
    "- Storing images as individual JPEG files is inefficient, as most training time is spent on data reading.\n",
    "- TensorFlow Record format is recommended for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Content\n",
    "\n",
    "- The 5-Flowers dataset consists of found data or images not explicitly collected for the classification task.\n",
    "- Purposeful data collection should be employed, if allowed by the problem domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "- This dataset was manually labeled, which can become impractical for larger datasets.\n",
    "- Labeling of images is a broad topic and needs careful consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NOTE:\n",
    "- your training dataset has to reflect the conditions under which your model will be required to make predictions"
