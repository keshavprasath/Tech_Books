    "### Theory of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)\n",
    "\n",
    "- RNNs are structured with recurrent layers, similar to standard feedforward neural networks (NNs).\n",
    "- They incorporate a hidden recurrent state that gets updated at each step during sequence processing.\n",
    "- At the start of processing any sequence, the model is initialized with a one-dimensional vector representing the hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each word in the sequence is fed into the model, leading to an update in the hidden state (HS).\n",
    "- This process continues until all words have been processed, generating a final hidden state vector.\n",
    "- This final HS vector is then fed into a fully connected layer to yield the final class prediction.\n",
    "- Activation functions, such as tanh, can be employed to constrain the hidden state values between -1 and 1.\n",
    "- During learning, weights are updated at each step, and the loss is computed during backpropagation.\n",
    "- For tasks such as sequence-to-sequence translation in NLP, hidden state values from each layer can be utilized instead of only the final HS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RNN for Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis becomes a binary classification task (i.e., positive or negative) when using RNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Challenges and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the challenges with RNNs is the occurrence of exploding or vanishing gradients due to the recursive layers, which can cause instability in the network.\n",
    "- Solutions include:\n",
    "  - Implementing gradient clipping to limit the gradients from becoming excessively large. This involves introducing a hyperparameter C to establish an upper limit.\n",
    "  - Reducing the input sequence length. Since a shorter sequence means fewer iterations, the maximum sequence length can be chosen as a hyperparameter.\n"
